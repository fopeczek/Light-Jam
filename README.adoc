    In a nutshell: A lightweight, portable, modular LED sound reactive lightning setup

.Beginnings and origin:
Inspired by light show in Toruń called https://bellaskyway.pl/en/[Bella Skyway], driven by my passion for engineering and dancing. +
First version of this project was made in 2024 in about 3 days as a proof of concept link:Light%20Jam%20v1/Light%20Jam%20v1.adoc[Light Jam v1]

.Current version:
After a bigger than expected success of the first version I decided to make a second, more professional version of this project called link:Light%20Jam2/Light%20Jam2.adoc[Light Jam²]

.Future plans:
In case the project lives long enough, I plan to make a third version of this project called: _Light Jam³/!Light Jam/Light Jam ∞_. A complete overhaul of the project featuring custom parts, which unfortunately would make this project way less accessible for reproduction for the average person.
